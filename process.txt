Project Management
-------
Our project management and issue tracking was handled partially through JIRA and partially through the burndown spreadsheet since we didn't gain access to JIRA until around our 2nd/3rd week. 

Our JIRA project is viewable here
http://office-hours.eecs.umich.edu:8080/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=8&projectKey=TQ&view=reporting&chart=burndownChart&sprint=12

We recorded issues and created 4 sprints with each sprint having deadlines that tracked with project submission deadlines.
Unfortunately, we were not able to figure out how to record time in the issues we created. There was no clearly indicated field for entering estimated time and completed time.

It seems, instead, that the Burndown report tracked "story points" which we did not assign to our issues.

Our burndown spreadsheet is also viewable, but it is not accurate since we did not keep it up to date after the first week.

Github
------
We used github to collborate and track all of our code changes. The repository is private so if you ever feel like looking at our commits, contact jayhan@umich.edu with your github username to be added to the repo.
